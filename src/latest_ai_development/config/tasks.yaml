#         - Service layer with business logic methods.

implement_application:
  description: >
      Based on the parsed requirements, create a fully functional Spring Boot application with the following:
        - Project setup:
            - Create a Maven project structure.
            - Write a `pom.xml` file with the following dependencies and versions:
              - Spring Boot Starter Web: `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web:3.2.2`
              - Spring Boot Starter Data JPA: `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa:3.2.2`
              - H2 Database: `com.h2database:h2:2.1.214`
              - Spring Boot Starter Test: `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test:3.2.2`
              - Jakarta Persistence API: `jakarta.persistence:jakarta.persistence-api:3.1.0`
            - Ensure compatibility with Java 17.
            - Write the main application class.
        - Persistence Layer:
            - Generate JPA entity classes using the `jakarta.persistence` package (not `javax.persistence`) and ensure that each entity class has getters and setters for all attributes.
            - Create Spring Data JPA repository interfaces.
            - Wrap all table names in `schema.sql` with double quotes to avoid issues with reserved keywords or special characters.
            - Write `schema.sql` and `data.sql` files for the H2 database in `/src/main/resources/`.
        - Service Layer:
            - Implement business logic methods to interact with the repository layer for CRUD operations.
        - Controller Layer:
            - Create REST controllers with appropriate mappings for all API endpoints.
        - H2 Database Configuration:
            - Add the following configuration to `application.properties`:
              ```
              spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
              spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
              spring.datasource.username=sa
              spring.datasource.password=password
              spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
              spring.h2.console.enabled=true
              ```
  expected_output: >
    A complete and runnable Spring Boot project written to disk in the appropriate folder structure, including configuration files, code, and SQL scripts in a folder called "gene-code". All persistence-layer code should use `jakarta.persistence`.

perform_testing:
  description: >
    Test the application against the API contract using tools like JUnit or Postman.
  expected_output: >
    A test report detailing passed/failed cases and coverage.
